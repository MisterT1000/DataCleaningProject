## The steps of my program are as follows

1.Read the features.txt file for a list of the signals
2.Save indicides that have mean and standard deviation
3.Remove parenthesis from feature names
4.Create a vector (col_widths) of the features to read and to skip and read the X test and train data into variables
5.Get the list of activity and subject labels and apply them to the data
6.Summarizes the data by subject and activity, averaging values across the sessions
7.Writes the data to a txt file
